# otp_demo_app

This repository contains the application which will give you the hackable demo environment of OTP Application. You can use your hack technique on this application. Also the scope of this application is very small right now, its just focuses on OTP hack techniques, also you may encounter some XSS scnerios and more which you can ignore them or you can exploit those for getting more view (but those are out of scope).
